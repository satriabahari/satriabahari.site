## 📘 Introduction

This is my personal website built from scratch since **February 2024** using modern technologies like **Next.js** and **TypeScript**.

I use this platform to:

- Showcase my portfolio and projects
- Share developer resources and stats
- Experiment with new web technologies

The site is continuously evolving. You’re welcome to fork or explore the source code. If you find it helpful, consider giving it a ⭐ on GitHub.

Have questions or feedback? I’d love to hear from you 🙌
